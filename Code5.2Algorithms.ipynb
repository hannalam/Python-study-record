    "#One concept you will encounter in future CS class is the\n",
    "#idea of a binary tree.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#A binary tree is made of nodes. Each node has three\n",
    "#attributes: its own value, a left branch, and a right branch.\n",
    "#The left branch will be lower than the node's own value, and\n",
    "#the right branch will be higher than the node's own value.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#Some nodes will not have any branches; these are called leaf\n",
    "#nodes. They only have their own value. Some nodes may have\n",
    "#only one branch as well.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#Every binary tree has a single root node at the top of the\n",
    "#tree. Most algorithms that operate on the tree will start at\n",
    "#this root node.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#For example, let us imagine a binary tree with seven nodes.\n",
    "#The top node's value is 10. The top node has two child nodes:\n",
    "#the left node's value is 5, lower than 10. The right node's\n",
    "#value is 15, higher than 10. Then, the left node has its own\n",
    "#left and right nodes, with values 3 and 7: the lower and higher\n",
    "#than 5 respectively, but both lower than 10 because they come\n",
    "#from the original node's left (lower) branch. The right node's\n",
    "#left and right branches have values 12 and 18, again lower\n",
    "#and higher than 15 but both higher than 10.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#Below is the code for a single node. Right function called\n",
    "#binary_tree_search. binary_tree_search should take two\n",
    "#parameters: a single node, and a search value. It should return\n",
    "#True if the search value is found anywhere in the tree with\n",
    "#the node at the top, and False if the search value is not found.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#To do this, you'll want to write a function that goes down the\n",
    "#tree similar to a binary search. If the search value is lower than\n",
    "#the current node's value, it should continue searching to the\n",
    "#left. If the search value is higher than the current node's value,\n",
    "#it should continue searching to the right. If the search value is\n",
    "#equal to the current node's value, it should return True. If the\n",
    "#current node has no children (both left and right are None), it\n",
    "#should return False as it has reached the bottom of the tree.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#You may assume that no two nodes will have the same value, and that\n",
    "#every node will have either two children or none. You should not\n",
    "#assume that the tree will have 7 nodes; it may have 3, 7, 15, 31,\n",
    "#or more.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#HINT: Try breaking this into cases. What do you do if the node\n",
    "#has the right value? What if the node is none? What if the node's\n",
    "#value is higher than the search term? What if it's lower?\n",
    "#\n",
    "#HINT 2: To get around not knowing how big the tree will be,\n",
    "#think about a process you can repeat over and over until either\n",
    "#you find the search term or reach a leaf node. To repeat that\n",
